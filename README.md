# ⚙️ Embedded Systems, Real-Time Programming, and Edge AI Roadmap – By Afsar Ahamed

## 🎯 Goal
Master low-level systems programming with C++, real-time operating systems, embedded development, GPU programming (CUDA), and edge AI deployment (TensorRT), while exploring modern alternatives like Rust and understanding the broader IoT and distributed systems landscape. This roadmap builds the foundation for robotics, smart devices, and intelligent real-time systems.

## 📍 Phase 0: Orientation – Why This Path?

### 🔎 What You'll Learn
- Why **C++ is used for both general and embedded systems**
- How **embedded C++** differs: no dynamic memory, stricter rules, safety-first, minimal STL use
- What makes **embedded environments** special (low power, low memory, hard real-time)
- Why we use **RTOS** and not just `while(true)` loops
- Why **GPU acceleration matters** and how CUDA helps
- **cuDNN vs TensorRT vs CUDA**: when to use what
- What is **IoT** and how it's a form of **distributed system** with sensors and micro-clouds
- What is **Rust**, and how it compares to C++ in embedded contexts

✅ **Outcome**: Clear mental model of the landscape from C++ basics → device logic → distributed edge AI

## 📍 Phase 1: Foundational C++ vs Embedded C++

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- What is "normal" C++: full STL, dynamic memory, RAII, exceptions
- What is "embedded" C++: safety-oriented subset, no heap, no exceptions, no RTTI
- Bitwise operations, hardware-level memory access
- Use of `volatile`, `const`, `static` with sensors & hardware registers
- Why `malloc/new` is avoided on MCUs
- CMake basics for embedded targets

### 📦 Projects
- Create C++ console app using full STL (sorting, vectors, etc.)
- Recreate logic using embedded-safe C++ patterns
- Write a mock embedded driver (no heap, no exceptions)

---

## 📍 Phase 2: Embedded Systems & Sensor Interfaces

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- MCU architecture: STM32, ESP32, Cortex-M
- GPIO, ADC, PWM, SPI, I2C, UART protocols
- Hardware interrupts and polling
- Digital vs analog sensors

### 📦 Projects
- Light sensor + LED dimming via PWM
- UART command interface
- I2C read from temperature sensor with conversion logic

---

## 📍 Phase 3: Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- Clock accuracy, watchdog timers
- System design for reliability and safety

### 📦 Projects
- Motion sensor interrupt handler + logger
- Preemptive task scheduler demo

- cuDNN: high-level deep learning acceleration on CUDA
- How to write and profile your own CUDA kernels

### 📦 Projects

## 📍 Phase 5: TensorRT for Edge AI Inference

### 🧠 Key Concepts

## 📍 Phase 7: Rust for Embedded (Optional)

### 🧠 Key Concepts
